# Issues

## Internal reference

Issues are referenced internally by an ID assigned by issues integration. E.g., projects tracking issues on GitHub might look like 'acme/a-project/1' where 'acme' is the GitHub owner, 'a-project' is the common project basename and '1' is the issue ID. The issue ID may be interogated by other integrations which expect the format particular to the integrations provider.
